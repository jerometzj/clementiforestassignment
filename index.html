	<b>Pack your bags! You don't want to miss this!</b> 
	<br> With muddy slopes, steep steps and deep puddes, this place is not going to be easy but worth it.

<li style="font-size: 20px; color: green"> Tunneling through </li>
<p> Once down the slope you'll see a tunnel to the right. That's the old railway tunnel! Take many nice photos and but do not enter there as it does not lead to the enchanted forest. Instead, your adventure awaits through the 
<b> LEFT SIDE </b> 
of the path.

	<u>The Arduous Journey</u> 
</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> This trail is not for beginners, the moment we entered, we faced our first obstacle...which was a fallen tree.

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> It just rained the day before, that's why it was so muddy. Be sure to check in with the weather both the day before and on the day itself so you know what to expect!

<h2>Magnificent trees</h2>

<p>There are many obstacles at the start but after overcoming those, we made it into the heart of the forest. Looking up we saw a tree that so a head over the rest!</p>

<h2>Leaf Umbrella</h2>

<p>There's also leaves as big as umbrellas that we could find shade under for a while!</p>

<li style="font-size: 20px; color: green"> The clearings </li>
<p> Following the path, we eventually came to clearings where we could see the vast beauty of the forest. What a sight to behold! You don't get this in the urban jungle.

	<u>The End</u> 
</h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Eventually, the forest path joins with the path in the green corridor and we found ourselves at the Old bukit Timah rail station. It was such an enjoyable trek, getting dirty together, helping each other through obstacles. Even though it was a challenging trek, it was worth it at the end of the day.
